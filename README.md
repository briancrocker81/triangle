# File reader script

This mini script runs through a file, iterating over each line adding the penultimate number to a total figure

## Version 1
This script took far too long to write. Its also a nasty mash of arrays.

# Version 2
This took al of 20 mins to write but could still be improved. Its slower than the first and I'm not completely onboard with the final result
