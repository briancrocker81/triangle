# File reader script

This mini script runs through a file, iterating over each line adding the penultimate number to a total figure

## Version 1
This script took far too long to write. Its also a nasty mash of arrays.

## Version 2
This took al of 20 mins to write but could still be improved. Its slower than the first and I'm not completely onboard with the final result

## Version 3
After a discussion with [Kevin Hughes](https://github.com/kevtufc) who put me onto reduce, this is a smaller, quicker and more concise entry
